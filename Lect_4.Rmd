# The Biodiversity Crisis


### Assigned readings

**Reading reflections due: Sept 18th, 5pm**

`r icon::fa("book-reader")` Cardinale et al. 2019. **Conservation Biology**. Chapter 8

`r icon::fa("book-reader")` Cardinale et al. 2019. **Conservation Biology**. Chapter 9

*Food for thought*

Is the current focus on a potential 6th mass extinction an overreaction?

We extensively discussed biodiversity and how it can be described at different hierarchical scales (genetic, species, ecosystem) and using different frameworks (compositional, structural, functional) and yet we are using extinction (complete loss at species level as our only measure) - do you think this is a good proxy?

Is pollution a type of habitat degradation or is habitat degradation one (of many) effects of pollution?

*Food for thought*

Before reading more about eutrophication, had you considered "nitrogen" a pollutant?

Consider how the formation of dead zones as a consequence of eutrophication might play with climate change, another important driver of biodiversity loss.

Consider how overexploitation differs from other drivers of biodiversity loss as we are directly causing increased mortality.

Consider how overexploitation has many stakeholders - how does this complicate mitigation?

### Outline: The Biodiversity Crisis

**Global Patterns of Biodiversity loss**

* State of Biodiversity
    + state of biodiversity declining trend
    + pressures of biodiversity increasing trend
    + responses to address loss increasing trend
* Understanding patterns of biodiversity loss
    + "levels" of extinction
    + tracking (future) loss through IUCN Red List
    + Global change in species diversity is a result of extinction & speciation
    + determining if contemporary accelerated loss of species diversity is a mass extinction requires determining the rate of extinction and the proportion of existing species being lost
    
**Drivers of Extinction**

* understanding drivers of extinction/biodiversity loss meanse we must address the ultimate causes of loss
    + increasing numbers of humans
    + increasing exploitation of natural resources
    + addressing the causes not the symptoms means implementing sustainable use of resources
* Drivers of the loss of biodiversity
    + Habitat loss/fragmentation
    + Pollution
    + Invasive species
    + Overexploitation
    + Climate change
* Multiple interacting threats can lead to synergistic effects
    + some taxonomic groups more affected than others
    + some habitats more affected than others
    
**Local & Regional Patterns of Biodiversity Loss**

* local changes in species diversity are result of local extirpation and migration/colonization
* expected number of extinctions due to habitat loss can be modeled using species/area relationships
    + expected/observed patterns are not always accurate
    + extinction debt
    + oversimplified assumptions
* biodiversity can be monitored using spatial and temporal comparisons
    + patterns of local changes in species diversity are not just net loss due to complex interactions
    + Experimental design is challenging & can be limiting to interpret results
    + Lack of clear baselines
    + Complete loss of species may not be adequate measure of impact
    + our assumptions of mechanisms are likely too simple

**Intrinsic Vulnerability of species**

* Some species are more vulnerable to extinction
    + high habitat specificity
    + limited geographic range
    + life-history parameters
    + demographics
    
* Stochastic effects make small populations more vulnerable
    + demographic stochasticity
    + environmental stochasticity
    
* Demographics
    + Population size
    + population growth rate
    + population density
    
* Habitat, range & connectivity
    + geographic range & habitat
    + connectivity and isolation
    
* Life history traits (triangular life history model)
    + lifespan, juvenile survivorship, adult mortality
    + age-at-maturity, fecundity
    + body size, growth
    
**Habitat Loss**

* Definition(s) of habitat loss
    + Habitat loss (destruction)
    + Habitat fragmentation
    + Habitat degradation
    
* Habitat loss resulting from land-use change is most significant driver of biodiversity loss

* Primary drivers of habitat loss
    + Agricultural expansion
    + Urbanization
    + Extractive Industries
    
* Effects of increasing land-use intensity on biodiversity
    + differential impacts on taxonomic groups
    + differential impacts on biomes
    + intensity of land-use & type of human-dominated ecosystem determines impact
    
**Habitat Fragmentation**

* Habitat fragmentation is more than habitat loss
    + reduction of habitats to size too small to support some species (may need large territory) 
    + Creation of large amounts of degraded “edge” habitat
    + may force species into a metapopulation structure (more vulnerable to stochastic effects)

* Habitat patch configuration determines impact
    + size of habitat patches
    + number of habitat patches
    + distance/isolation among habitat patches
    + area:perimeter ratio of patches (edge habitat)

* Patch size & number
    + Decrease in patch size results in decrease of original habitat remaining (species-area relationship)
    + Extinction thresholds: Threshold of habitat size required for species persistence
    + number of patches often highest at intermediate levels of habitat loss
    + Patches in a landscape can be sufficiently heterogeneous to increase diversity across landscape by adding new species (create new niches)
    
* Edge habitat/Edge effects
    + edge habitats (ecotones) mark the transition between two different habitats
    + increased fragmentation means landscapes consist of increasing number of small patches
    + Proportion of edge habitat increases as patch gets small
    + Proportion of interior (core) habitat decrease with patch size 
    + Perimter:Area ratio increases as patch size decreases
    + Edge Effects are physical & biological changes occurring at patch edges (example forest canopy stabilizes microclimate)
    + Edge habitats have winners
* Patch isolation
    + Isolation is function of distance between habitat patches & the matrix that separates them
    + Barriers to dispersal (roads, railway, fences, water channels) may also result in fragmentation
    + organisms with ontogenetic shifts and isolated/small populations at greater risks
    + may force species into meta-population structure
    
**Metapopulations**

* Patchy landscape may force meta-population structures
    + habitats lost/converted to human use and/or heavily degraded
    + Intact patches are small, fragmented & disconnected
    + Small, isolated populations in single habitat patch are highly vulnerable to extinction
    + Species may persist as a whole if patches are connected by occasional movement (dispersal/migration resulting in gene flow)
    
* Metapopulation structures
    + Definition: Collection of local populations spatially separated (individual habitat patches) connected by dispersal
    + Landscape has habitat patches that are suitable but unoccupied
    + Individuals in small, localized populations have limited lifetime (local extinctions
    + Suitable habitats are (re)colonized
    + Metapopulation as a whole persists if rate of colonization > rate of extinction
    
* Source-sink dynamics
    + Habitat patches vary in quality & size 
    + some populations (sinks) relying on constant input of immigrants from populations in high quality habitat patches (sources)
    
* Metapopulation theory applied to conservation
    + predict extinction risk
    determine patch size & connectivity thresholds to restore habitat/ensure long-term persistence

### Review

1. Define what a species extinction and its consequences are.

2. Describe the difference between a species being globally extinct, extinct in the wild, extirpated, and functionally extinct. 

3. List the two mechanisms resulting in global change in species diversity. Contrast these with the two mechanisms resulting in local/regional change in species diversity.

4. Define what a mass extinction event and what the background extinction rate are.

5. Give a testable hypothesis for a mass extinction rate and use that to argue whether or not we are currently experiencing the "6th mass extinction".

6. Give a brief description of the current accelerated loss of biodiversity and contrast that to the five mass extinctions our planet experienced in geological history.

7. List the five major categories of drivers of biodiversity loss. Contrast them in terms of their contributions to biodiversity loss across broad categories of vertebrates and habitats.

8. Compare and contrast spatial and temporal designs to monitor biodiversity. Argue which one you think is more informative.

9. Compare and contrast the observed global pattern of biodiversity loss with the local/regional change in species diversity.

10. Define what intrinsic vulnerability is and list the four major factors that contribute to the intrinsic vulnerability of a species.

11. Compare and contrast demographic and environmental stochasticity and explain how they can contribute to species extinction.

12. Population size, density and growth rates are important parameters determining the demographics of a population. For each briefly assess how they can increase vulnerability to extinction.

13. Habitat, range, and connectivity among populations are important ecological characteristics that may contribute to the likelihood of a species going extinct. Explain.

14. Argue whether having migration and/or a dispersal stage as part of the life history of a species increase or decreases the extinction risk of a species?

15. The triangular life history model groups individuals into opportunistic, periodic, and equilibrium species based on the optimization of three demographic parameters, generation time, juvenile survivorship, and fecundity. Opportunistic species are characterized by short generation times, low juvenile survivorship, and low fecundity. Equilibrium species are characterized by high juvenile survivorship, long generation times, and low juvenile survivorship. Finally, periodic species are characterized by high fecundity, low juvenile survivorship, and long generation times. Argue how you would rank these life history strategies by level intrinsic vulnerability of the species.

16. List important life history parameters to consider when assessing the intrinsic vulnerability of a species, indicate how they increase/decrease intrinsic vulnerability. You can create a table where you list the parameter and then use arrows to indicate if intrinsic vulnerability increases/decreases as that parameter increases/decreases.

e.g.

parameter        |   | intrinsic vulnerability |
-----------------|---| ----------------------- |
age-at-maturity | ↑ |  ↑                      |


17a Elephants generally have small population and their life history is characterized by a late-age-at maturity, high parental care, and long generation time. By contrast, squirrels are abundant throughout their wide geographic range. Their life history is characterized by a short generation time, and high fecundity. Argue which species has the higher intrinsic vulnerability. 

17b Plot twist: The British red squirrel has a geographic range extending from Siberia to Ireland and despite its overall abundance decreasing it is categorized as a species of least concern by the IUCN. Since the introduction of gray squirrels from North America this invasive species frequently outcompetes native red squirrels and (ironically) transmits a squirrelpox virus lethal to native red squirrels which are now only found in a few small population in southern Scotland. Argue whether you think the British red squirrel is correctly categorized by the IUCN.

18. Define habitat loss/destruction, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation.

19. List the main drivers of habitat loss.

20. Briefly describe how land-use change results in habitat loss and describe how variation in the land-use intensity may have differential impacts on the biodiversity.

21. Compare and contrast habitat loss and habitat fragmentation in terms of their impact on biodiversity.

22. Briefly describe the main effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.

23. List the four parameters used to describe habitat patch configuration and briefly describe their relationship to habitat loss (you may sketch a figure but make sure to label axis).

24. Briefly explain how habitat patch size and number affect biodiversity (remember "explain" means you need to describe the effect + give a "why").

25. Briefly describe the term Extinction Threshold.

26. Describe the relationship of edge habitat, loss of biodiversity and patch size & number.

27. Define what edge effects are and use an example to explain how they result in additional degradation of the remaining habitat patches.

28. List the three main groups of species that may benefit from edge effects; describe one of the parameters using an example.

29. The isolation of of habitat patches is a function of the geographic distance between them and the parameters of the matrix separating them. Explain.

30. Briefly describe three ways that patch isolation and barriers negatively affect organisms potentially increasing their extinction risk.

31. Give a brief description of what a metapopulation using a brief definition and listing key characteristics. 

32. Explain how habitat fragmentation forcing species into a meta-population structure can increase extinction risk as a whole

32. Metapopulations are characterized by source-sink dynamics. Explain what this means and argue how this effect can allow a population affected by habitat fragmentation to persist despite local extirpations.

33. Give a brief description of how metapopulation theory can be applied to conservation.

34. Habitat fragmentation has resulted in species A being restricted to a series of small, highly isolated habitat patches. By contrast, species B has several suitable habitat patches available that are connected by dispersal, though in some locations there have been local extirpations due to stochastic effects. In both cases, the local populations are small and some habitats have been further degraded by pollution. Compare and contrast these two species and their local populations in terms of their extinction risk.
