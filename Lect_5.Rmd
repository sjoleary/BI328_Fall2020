# Species-level conservation

### Assigned readings

**Reading reflections due: Oct. 16th, 5pm**

`r icon::fa("book-reader")` Cardinale et al. 2019. **Conservation Biology**. Chapter 16


*Food for thought*

Consider pros and cons of zoos and aquariums by necessity keeping animals in captivity. Do you object on principle or do you think that the "how" is important?

### Outline

**Wildlife Trade**

* Global wildlife trade is a multibillion dollar industry
    + wide array of species (25% of terrestrial species affected)
    + impacts of trade concentrated in certain phylogenetic groups leading to potential for substantial long-term impact on certain lineages
    + Wildlife trade richness & hotspots of wildlife trade concentrated in tropics
* Legal Wildlife trade
    + Primates
    + wild-caught fish + coral
    + Main exporters: South East Asia & Amazon
* Is (legal) wildlife trade sustainable?
    + many species can be sustainably exploited resulting in potential for sustainable commercial trade
    + uncontrolled trafficking/overexploitation can result in serious threat to local populations
* Regulating the wildlife trade (CITES)
    + Multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants/animals by regulating unsustainable wildlife trade
    + Signatories voluntarily adopt their own domestic legislation
    + demand is met by captive breeding/farming, harvesting from the wild and illegal harvesting/poaching
    + lack of monitoring & enforcement are major contributors to resulting illegal trade
* Illegal wildlife trade
    + Primary driver of illegal trade is black market prices for rare specimen & body parts used for traditional medicine, folk remedies, status symbols, collector items
    + global problem but major concentration in South Africa & Southeast Asia
    + mammals/mammal derivates 51% of all seizures: skins, pelts, furs (26%) and ivory (25%) make up half of seized mammal derivates
    + 76% of seizures included species listed on CITES Appendix I or II
    + Orchids represent > 70% of 30,000 CITES-listed species 
    + organized crime create international trafficking networks to fund illegal hunting, trapping & smuggling of high values wildlife
* How can we combat illegal wildlife trade?
    + poaching is more than an enforcement problem
    + huge economic disparity between key markets & primary source countries makes illegal trade lucrative (if risky) source of income
    + enforcement involves a cost/benefit analysis of conservation vs poaching (turn poachers into protectors)
    + mitigating wildlife trade can be achieved by increasing enforcement or decreasing demand
    + illegal trade can be combated by promoting sustainable trade
* Wildlife forensics are a valuable tool to enforce regulations
    + Wildlife trade and fraudulence in food, artefacts, and cosmetic industries may impact wildlife
    + Lack of proper tools to identify & trace products (species/region of origin) can be a major constraint to frame charges against poachers/smugglers by law enforcement
    + wildlife forensics methods must be fast, accurate & reliable with comprehensive coverage/easy accessibility to aid criminal investigation processes

### Debrief

Go over your notes & briefly answer these questions:

*	What was the most muddy concept(s)? Do we need to further clarify?
*	What was the exciting, interesting, or a new concept you learned?
*	Was there any “assumed background knowledge” you didn’t have? Do we need to further clarify?
*	Any additional general comments or questions on today's lecture or this week’s lab?

Submit your answers [`r icon::fa("clipboard-list")`](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_wpIenOLXtsZ24-3Aa120mgZmN3ioZHVkA342ZCYOj5OQug/viewform?usp=sf_link).
