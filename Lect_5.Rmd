### Outline

**Wildlife Trade**

* Global wildlife trade is a multibillion dollar industry
    + wide array of species (25% of terrestrial species affected)
    + impacts of trade concentrated in certain phylogenetic groups leading to potential for substantial long-term impact on certain lineages
    + Wildlife trade richness & hotspots of wildlife trade concentrated in tropics
* Legal Wildlife trade
    + Primates
    + wild-caught fish + coral
    + Main exporters: South East Asia & Amazon
* Is (legal) wildlife trade sustainable?
    + many species can be sustainably exploited resulting in potential for sustainable commercial trade
    + uncontrolled trafficking/overexploitation can result in serious threat to local populations
* Regulating the wildlife trade (CITES)
    + Multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants/animals by regulating unsustainable wildlife trade
    + Signatories voluntarily adopt their own domestic legislation
    + demand is met by captive breeding/farming, harvesting from the wild and illegal harvesting/poaching
    + lack of monitoring & enforcement are major contributors to resulting illegal trade
* Illegal wildlife trade
    + Primary driver of illegal trade is black market prices for rare specimen & body parts used for traditional medicine, folk remedies, status symbols, collector items
    + global problem but major concentration in South Africa & Southeast Asia
    + mammals/mammal derivates 51% of all seizures: skins, pelts, furs (26%) and ivory (25%) make up half of seized mammal derivates
    + 76% of seizures included species listed on CITES Appendix I or II
    + Orchids represent > 70% of 30,000 CITES-listed species 
    + organized crime create international trafficking networks to fund illegal hunting, trapping & smuggling of high values wildlife
* How can we combat illegal wildlife trade?
    + poaching is more than an enforcement problem
    + huge economic disparity between key markets & primary source countries makes illegal trade lucrative (if risky) source of income
    + enforcement involves a cost/benefit analysis of conservation vs poaching (turn poachers into protectors)
    + mitigating wildlife trade can be achieved by increasing enforcement or decreasing demand
    + illegal trade can be combated by promoting sustainable trade
* Wildlife forensics are a valuable tool to enforce regulations
    + Wildlife trade and fraudulence in food, artefacts, and cosmetic industries may impact wildlife
    + Lack of proper tools to identify & trace products (species/region of origin) can be a major constraint to frame charges against poachers/smugglers by law enforcement
    + wildlife forensics methods must be fast, accurate & reliable with comprehensive coverage/easy accessibility to aid criminal investigation processes

**Ex situ conservation**

* Ex situ conservation can contribute to in situ conservation strategies.
* Zoos & Aquariums
    + Animals/fish are housed in human-built enclosures and displayed to the public may also be used for research and/or breeding programs
    + Threatened animal species can find temporary refuge in zoos/aquariums
    + some species are extinct in the wild but extant specimen exist in captivity
    + criticism of zoos include concerns of ethical welfare of animals and that money would be better spent if directly used for conservation
    + Zoos are addressing points of critisicm and re-inventing themselves as conservation centers
* Botanical Gardens/arboretums
    + Botanical gardens are dedicated to the collection, cultivation, and preservation of plants – may contain specialized collections of specific plant groups or represent biomes
    + Arboretum specialized collection of woody plants/trees
    + Purpose: Curation of medical plants, Taxonomy/collections for research programs, Assist in propagation & dissemination of plants for horticulture, agriculture, forestry, landscaping, restoration efforts, industry
* Gene and Seed banks are biorepositories preserving genetic material
    + Frozen zoos collect & hold tissues, cells, gametes & DNA of endangered animals in cryogenic freezers to assist with reproduction through artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, and cloning (future plans).
    + Seed banks stock & preserve seeds that can be germinated later to produce new plants.
Most seeds can be stored for extended periods in cold/dry conditions at low cost with minimal supervision
* Contributions to in situ conservation
    + Captive breeding programs
    + reintroduction/reinforcement
    + education & public outreach
    
**Species-level conservation**

* primary goal of species-level conservation is to ensure persistence of a species
    + after threats are identified & removed where possible tit needs to be ensured tha the remaining population(s) are sufficiently large to persist
    + to ensure long-term viability a populations must have Sufficient individuals in population to survive & reproduce to maintain positive growth rate and sufficient genetic diversity in population to maintain adaptive potential & avoid inbreeding depression
    + populations may be restored using assisten colonization, reintroduction, and augmentation strategies
* Decision-making and trade-offs
    + every conservation effort has trade-offs (ecological, economic, social)
    + every implemented conservation action is one of a suite of possible actions
    + Structured decision-making offers a transparent and data-driven framework to evaluate potential decisions for management of natural resources 
* Strategic species conservation
    + Surrogate species provide an efficient means for achieving broader conservation goals
    + Flagship species is used to attract the attention of the public (usually about the plight of a specific ecosystem or region)
    + Umbrella species provides protective umbrella that benefits other species (usually large home range)

**Estimating population size**

* Census
    + Count number of individuals present in a populations and monitor changes using repeated census over successive time intervals
    + limitations of census include that they are frequently not repeated and that a census should be a complete count but rarely actually is
    + Census of a biological community or geographic region determines what species are currently present in a locality
    + Temporal and spatial comparisons enable us to understand changes in geographic ranges & local abundance
    
* Mark-recapture
    + Individuals of a population are caught & marked during first sampling period
    + During second sampling period the number of recaptured individuals are recorded
    + Abundance is estimated based on the ratio of recaptured animals to total animals captured during second period

* Population models
    + Models allowing us to estimate population change over time are an important conservation tool to simulated how changes in a landscape may impact populations
    + Models are (over)simplifications and based on best available sample information (frequently approximations)
    + Changing conditions (habitat fragmentation, change in periodicity of weather events, environmental change) are more or less straightforward to model
    + Population growth models: geometric growth, exponential growth, logistic growth.
    + Age/stage-based models estimate fecundity and survival probability by age classes/life stages and allows for better understanding of demographic structure (number of individuals at each life stage/year class)
    + Deterministic models have fixed values (constants) that reflect average values across life stages 
    + Stochastic models account for variation in model parameters among time points
