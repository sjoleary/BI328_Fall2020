If I gave you $1 billion to invest in conservation â€“ how would you spend it and why? You have all semester to come up with an answer. There will be three deadlines to help you spread out the work across the semester, first you will work through a small assignment to help you choose your topic, then you will hand in an outline + annotated bibliography, and finally your term paper (approx. 2,500 words). We will discuss details in person, and I will make detailed guidelines available. 
Due dates are 9/4 (topics), 10/5 (outline + annotated bibliography), 11/23 (term paper).


1. Quick assignment to help you choose your topic along with topics for case studies (**due 9/4**).
2. Outline + annotated bibliography (**due 10/5**).
3. Term paper (approx. 2,500 words **due 11/23**).
