Over the course of the semester, you will maintain an annotated bibliography as a “living document” (i.e. update it as you go) to help you keep track of materials outside of our textbook. This will include your readings for lectures, labs, articles you shared for the “conservation IRL” assignment, and resources for your conservation biology case studies and term paper.
