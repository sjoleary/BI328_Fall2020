# Ecosystem & Landscape-level conservation

### Assigned readings

**Reading reflections due: Nov. 13th, 5pm**

`r icon::fa("book-reader")` Cardinale et al. 2019. **Conservation Biology**. Chapter 14

`r icon::fa("book-reader")` Cardinale et al. 2019. **Conservation Biology**. Chapter 15


*Food for thought*

Why do you think historically conservation focused more on the species-level?
Do you think focusing on the minimum viable population or the minimum required habitat is more effective?
Why do you think it can be more difficult to engage the public in a campaign to conserve a specific endangered species compared to implementing protected areas?

*	What was the most muddy concept(s)? Do we need to further clarify?
*	What was the exciting, interesting, or a new concept you learned?
*	Was there any “assumed background knowledge” you didn’t have? Do we need to further clarify?
*	Any additional general comments or questions on today's lecture or this week’s lab?

Submit your answers [`r icon::fa("clipboard-list")`](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_wpIenOLXtsZ24-3Aa120mgZmN3ioZHVkA342ZCYOj5OQug/viewform?usp=sf_link).
