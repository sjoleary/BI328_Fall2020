# Class & Lab Participation

Next to traditional in-class lab & lecture participation we have two assignments to help you engange with the covered material inside and outside the classroom.

### LECTURE DEBRIEF

This assignment is meant to be a quick reflection on the material covered during class to help me assess where everyone is at and to help you follow up. After each lecture, you will answer these four questions (very, very) briefly.

*	What was the most muddy concept(s)? Do we need to further clarify?
*	What was the exciting, interesting, or a new concept you learned?
*	Was there any “assumed background knowledge” you didn’t have? Do we need to further clarify?
*	Any additional general comments or questions on today's lecture or this week’s lab?

**Due by 3pm the day after lecture.** No late work will be accepted or receive credit.


### “CONSERVATION IRL”
It is important to learn to make connections between the topics and concepts we cover during class and the real world. You will find that once you are aware of it that you encounter “Conservation Biology” all. the. time. 
For this weekly assignment you will share one of these encounters in 5-10 sentences with the class using our slack channel. This could be a podcast you listened to, an interesting documentary you watched, an article or essay in the news, a conversation you had with somebody in person or on social media, ... 
It does not have to be a “positive” encounter – this could also be a statement you came across that you think is incorrect or a position you disagree with. Whenever possible post a link for everyone who is interested to be able to follow up. Here are a few prompts to guide your post:

*	Give a concise 1 – 2 sentence summary or state the main point that stuck out to you.
*	How does it connect to our class?
*	What did you find helpful?
*	What new thing did you learn?
*	Is there a question that came up you would like to clarify?
*	Was there some information you found unsettling? Did something seem incorrect?
*	Was your encounter extremely biased in a certain direction?

**Due by Sunday 5pm each week** though you are encouraged to post at any time during the week. If you post an initial ‘Conservation IRL’ by Aug 23rd (first half week of classes) you may cash that freebie in later that semester if needed, otherwise no late work will be accepted or receive credit. 


# Writing assignments & presentations

### ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY 
Over the course of the semester, you will maintain an annotated bibliography as a “living document” (i.e. update it as you go) to help you keep track of materials outside of our textbook. This will include your readings for lectures, labs, articles you shared for the “conservation IRL” assignment, and resources for your conservation biology case studies and term paper. 
[Details](https://bi328.netlify.app/bibliography.html).


### CONSERVATION BIOLOGY CASE STUDY
Over the course of the semester you will dig into three case studies in the form of at least one written summary and one 10-minute presentation. Topics may include conservation efforts for an endangered species or ecosystem, biography of a conservation biologist or environmental scientist, or a specific piece of legislation - out of the out of the box ideas welcome – but clear them with me first.

### TERM PAPER
If I gave you $1 billion to invest in conservation – how would you spend it and why? You have all semester to come up with an answer. There will be three deadlines to help you spread out the work across the semester [Details](https://bi328.netlify.app/termpaper.html).

1. Quick assignment to help you choose your topic along with topics for case studies (**due 9/4**).
2. Outline + annotated bibliography (**due 10/5**).
3. Term paper (approx. 2,500 words **due 11/23**).
