# Class & Lab Participation

Next to traditional in-class lab & lecture participation we have two assignments to help you engage with the covered material inside and outside the classroom.

### LECTURE DEBRIEF

This assignment is meant to be a quick reflection on the material covered during class to help me assess where everyone is at and to help you follow up. After each lecture, you will answer these four questions (very, very) briefly.

*	What was the most muddy concept(s)? Do we need to further clarify?
*	What was the exciting, interesting, or a new concept you learned?
*	Was there any “assumed background knowledge” you did not have? Do we need to further clarify?
*	Any additional general comments or questions on today's lecture or this week’s lab?

Submit your answers [`r icon::fa("clipboard-list")`](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_wpIenOLXtsZ24-3Aa120mgZmN3ioZHVkA342ZCYOj5OQug/viewform?usp=sf_link).

**Due by 3pm the day after lecture.**  
No late work will be accepted or receive credit.


### CONSERVATION IRL
It is important to learn to make connections between the topics and concepts we cover during class and the real world. You will find that once you are aware of it that you encounter “Conservation Biology” all. the. time.  
For this weekly assignment you will share one of these encounters in 5-10 sentences with the class using our slack channel. This could be a podcast you listened to, an interesting documentary you watched, an article or essay in the news, a conversation you had with somebody in person or on social media, ...  
It does not have to be a “positive” encounter – this could also be a statement/article you came across that you think is incorrect or a position you disagree with. Whenever possible post a link for everyone who is interested to be able to follow up. Here are a few prompts to guide your post:

*	Give a concise 1 – 2 sentence summary or state the main point that stuck out to you.
*	How does it connect to our class?
*	What did you find helpful?
*	What new thing did you learn?
*	Is there a question that came up you would like to clarify?
*	Was there some information you found unsettling? Did something seem incorrect?
*	Was your encounter extremely biased in a certain direction?

**Due by Sunday 5pm each week** though you are encouraged to post at any time during the week.  
No late work will be accepted or receive credit.  
*If you post an initial ‘Conservation IRL’ by Aug 23rd (first half week of classes) you may cash that freebie in later that semester if needed.*


### READING REFLECTIONS

You should be reading assigned chapters and other materials before each lecture. Check our course site for the most upcoming readings to make sure you are not missing any. Readings will be assigned at least three days in advance. The reading reflections should be about 500 words (no less than 300 words), try not to go over 750 words (be concise). This assignment is supposed to help me gauge what you are getting out of the readings and to help you hold yourself accountable to actually engage with the material. A good way to approach this is to take notes while your read, then summarize those – this will help you pull out the most important information. Remember, our final is cumulative and open book, so good note-keeping will pay off down the line.

For book chapters, review articles, or reports a good starting point is to list the three to five most important concepts and/or major conclusions, and if appropriate relevant case studies supporting those. For research articles draw out the central hypothesis being tested, or question asked, what type of data set was generated to answer the question, and key results/major conclusions. In all cases, you will want to list statements/keywords that were unclear, that you have questions about or disagree with, or flaws you see in the line of argument.

**Due by 5pm each week** (covering that week's readings).  
No late work will be accepted or receive credit. The first reading reflection is due Aug. 28th covering reading assigned for Aug 24th - 28th.


# Writing assignments & presentations

### ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY 
Over the course of the semester, you will maintain an annotated bibliography as a “living document”.  
This will include your readings for lectures, labs, articles you shared for the “conservation IRL” assignment, and resources for your conservation biology case studies and term paper.  
[Details](https://bi328.netlify.app/bibliography.html).


### CONSERVATION BIOLOGY CASE STUDY
Over the course of the semester you will dig into three case studies in several formats.  
Topics may include for example, conservation efforts for an endangered species or ecosystem, biography of a conservation biologist or environmental scientist, or a specific piece of legislation.  
[Details](https://bi328.netlify.app/case-study.html).


### TERM PAPER
If I gave you $1 billion to invest in conservation – how would you spend it and why?  
This assignment is structure to give you all semester to come develop an answer.
