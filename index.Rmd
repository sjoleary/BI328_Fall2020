# Course Objectives

After completing this course, you should be able to

1.	Describe what biodiversity is, how we measure levels of biodiversity, and the value thereof.
2.	Explain the patterns and processes leading to the observed ongoing, drastic decline in biodiversity. 
3.	Apply fundamental principles from a variety of fields, including ecology, genetics, systematics, toxicology, economics, and creative problem-solving to management and conservation of biodiversity.
4.  Apply the theoretical framework, field, lab, and computational techniques to current management and conservation concerns, including
    + Being able to evaluate sources/content of information.
    + Gaining an overview of commonly used techniques to monitor biodiversity.
    + Understanding how large data sets & modeling can be used to enable sound conservation/management decision-making.
